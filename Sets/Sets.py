Sets
    A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements.
    The major advantage of using a set, as opposed to a list, is that it has a highly optimized method for checking
    whether a specific element is contained in the set.
    This is based on a data structure known as a hash table.
    represented in {}
Frozen Sets
     Frozen sets are immutable objects that only support methods and operators that produce a result without
     effecting the frozen set or sets to which they are applied
