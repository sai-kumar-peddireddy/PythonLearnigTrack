Inplace operators behave similar to normal operators except that they act in a different manner in case of
mutable and Immutable targets.

_iadd_ method also takes two arguments, but it makes in-place change in 1st argument passed by storing the sum in it.
As object mutation is needed in this process, immutable targets such as numbers, strings and tuples, shouldnâ€™t have
 _iadd_ method.

import operator

a = 10
b = 15

# inplace in immutable
x = operator.add(a, b)  # normal addition which is similar to x = a+b

print("a =", a, "b =", b, "\noperator.add(a, b)=", x)
print("a =", a, "b =", b)
print("--------------------")
operator.iadd(a, b)  # inplace operator iadd which is similar to a = a+b or a+= b but this does't work on immutable

print("a =", a, "b =", b)
